# Continuous Funnel Generation Algorithm

This code accompanies the paper submitted to the RSS 2020 workshop titled "PAPER_TITLE" by Taylor P. Reynolds, Danylo Malyuta, Mehran Mesbahi and Behcet Acikmese from the University of Washington.

Using a simple 2D planar quadrotor model, the code computes a funnel around a pre-set nominal trajectory in order to demonstrate the use of temporally-interpolated quadratic Lyapunov functions. 

## Installation Guide

To use this code, you will need to clone the repository and include the submodule YALMIP. Using

`git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:tpreynolds/RSS_2020.git`

should do the trick. *You will need to install an additional solver to use the code*. 

### Solver Specifics
The code was developed using MOSEK, which can be [installed from here](https://www.mosek.com/downloads/), and free academic licenses are available. 

Depending on where the solver is installed on your machine, you may need to edit the `utils/set_path.m` file. Open this file and change the value of `solverroot` on line 27 to be wherever you've just installed the solver you intend to use. The picture below is my setup for MOSEK.

*If you are not using MOSEK*, add a line to the `main.m` file (anywhere before line 28) that says `cfga.opts.solver = 'solvername';`. The `solvername` here must match whatever YALMIP calls the solver that you intend to use.
